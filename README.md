# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code and provides a solution.

The bug involves improper exception handling in an asynchronous function that fetches data from an API. The original code catches exceptions but simply rethrows them without providing additional context, making debugging difficult.

The solution improves the error handling by providing more informative error messages, logging the error details, and potentially implementing retry logic.
